        <p>Though I do not have much experience in the field. I actively participate in Technical
            and business events, such as YCommidator. As well as study to learn all I can about
            coding. As a Junior at Make School, I take the extra step to self teach myself more
            and sit in on extra classes. I intend to do as much as I can. While also having fun 
            teaching myself and making use out of the projects I make on the little free time
            I have.</p>

        <aside>My main objective is to learn all that I can, grow as a person, and 
            just overall having a good time.</aside>

            have the answer now. He will start playing with it and wrapping his head around how to
            fix it. He undersells himself, and I'm proud of my boy."

             work. We support him in his choice to focus on academics, and getting his BA. But if
             he ever needs it, I wouuld recommend him a spot back into In N Out."
