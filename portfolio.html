                            Toeta is the solution for you. The goal of this project was to solve the ever-lasting
                            question "What do I want to eat today?". With many plans for the future as to what this
                            project should be, it currently just gives a random recipe using spoonacular API. It took a
                            lot of time to get this thing to go server-side, given that static websites aren't meant to
                            be on clouds, so I made a PHP backend to solve this problem and hope for this to become much
                            more in the future.</p>

                            group affairs and meet deadlines was a harsh learning curve. However the idea was great, and
                            the journey was greater. I was in charge of the git-flow, and web hosting using Heroku
                            connecting it to our MongoDB NoSQL. I learned a lot about team-oriented programming, git,

                            them flash to music. I still use these lights to this day, and they make great party lights.

                            weeks. Learning Arduino, electrical currents, and microphone information. I also wrote an
                            article so that others could learn from my mistakes.</p>

                            <p>"I recommend my former student, Anthony Protho. I was his teacher for 4 years of high
                                school engineering courses and his competitive robotics coach. Anthony was the
                                designated programmer on his engineering and robotics teams. Anthony always strives for
                                excellence, going above and beyond the minimum requirements. He is naturally curious and
                                always worked to learn new programming concepts, implement good programming practices,
                                and attempt more complicated algorithms to give his teams a competitive advantage. He
                                demonstrates grit and perseverance, not giving up in the face of difficulty. His efforts
                                contributed greatly to his team, becoming one of the top rated robotics teams across the
                                whole state of California, qualifying to compete at the California High School Robotics
                                State Championships. Anthony is more than a competent programmer, but also a great
                                teacher. Other programmers on other teams from our school, looked up to Anthony as he
                                would often help them debug errors in their code and offer advice and suggestions.
                                Anthony is inspiring to all around him for he has large, lofty goals, and can always be
                                seen working and making real progress in accomplishing those goals. Anthony has become
                                one of the most successful, competent, and capable software developers I have had the
                                privilege of teaching and getting to know, and I highly recommend him to you."</p>

                    <h3>Before High School</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PES: Worked in the OilField helping out with whatever was asked of me, including breaking
                            pipes and running wells (2011-2018).</li>
                        <li>Valencia Farms: Worked in the fields as a harvester picking grapes (2015).</li>
                        <li>Pool boy helping neighbors clean their pool was a small-time thing, and the neighbor has
                            moved since (2013).</li>
                        <li>Moved a lot! This may not seem like much of a skill but learning to adapt to new
                            environments consistently was a large trial for me and has also helped me learn how to
                            communicate better with strangers (having met so many new ones). I also kept good grades in
                            school despite being bullied, lacking information, and having to deal with family turmoil.
                            However is also the reason for my lisp, and gaps in some foundational education (2001-2009).
