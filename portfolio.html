                        Toeta is the solution for you. The goal of this project was to solve the ever lasting question
                        "What do I want to eat today?". With many plans for the future as what this project should be,
                        it currently just gives a random recipe using spoonacular API. It took a lot of time to get
                        this thing to go server side, given that static websites aren't meant to be on clouds, so I made
                        a php backend to solve this problem, and hope for this to become much more in the future.</p>

                        together was insane. However the idea was great, and the journey was greater. I was in charge of
                        ensuring that all pushes, merges, and pulls were cleanly done
                        in git, as well as making sure that the server could run on a live server, and making sure that
                        the database information could be interpreted by our website. I learned a lot about team

                        how Audrino, currents, and microphone information. I also
