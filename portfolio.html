                <p>&emsp; Artist, Software Developer, Hardware Engineer, Go-Getter, Friend, I am this and much more. But
                    most of all I am a
                    student
                    who wants to learn. I have created an abundance of projects (some of which you will see below), and
                    hope to build a lot more that help
                    produce a better future for everyone. I hope to grow as a leader, creator, and overall
                    person.
                    My main goals include finish all my personal projects, helping all I can, and overall just having a
                    good time. Life is too short not to love it.</p>

                        Toeta is the solution for you. The goal of this project was to solve the ever lasting question
                        "What do I want to eat today?". With many plans for the future as what this project should be,
                        it currently just gives a random recipe using spoonacular API. It took a lot of time to get
                        this thing to go server side, given that static websites aren't meant to be on clouds, so I made
                        a php backend to solve this problem, and hope for this to become much more in the future. See

                        stress that went into this project, involving teamwork affairs, and making everything come
                        together was insane. However the idea was great, and the journey was greater. I was in charge of
                        ensuring that all pushes, merges, and pulls were cleanly done
                        in git, as well as making sure that the server could run on a live server, and making sure that
                        the database information could be interpreted by our website. I learned a lot about team
                        oriented programing, git, and backend programing. See more

                        I pushed the members of our team to do their parts and stayed on top of mine to ensure that our

                <p class="hr">Nov. 2018 - Aug. 2019</p>
                <p>Gained a bunch of soft skills from my first ever real job. It was a fast-paced environment, where I
                    worked mostly as a bilingual cashier and on customer services. Heavily based on communication and
                    teamwork skills I was responsible for taking orders, Cleaning, Making French Fries and drinks, and
                    serving customers with a smile. This job had a very bright and hardworking environment that I really
                    came to enjoy, and taught me the importance of customer's happiness, sales, and safety.

                <p>This was really a job of diligence, with freezing mornings to hot afternoons bending over to pick
                    ready grapes. The largest barrier being language, and having to communicate best I could knowing a
                    lot less spanish than I do now. This job taught me about humbleness, gratitude, and working smarter
                    over working harder.</p>
