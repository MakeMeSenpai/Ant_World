    <blockquote>"Anthony is a problem solver. Even if he doesn't know how to do something or
        have the answer now. He will start playing with it and wrapping his head around how to
        fix it. He undersells himself, and I'm proud of my boy."

    <blockquote>"Anthony was always a hasty worker. Always bringing a positive attitude to 
        work. We support him in his choice to focus on academics, and getting his BA. But if
        he ever needs it, I wouuld recommend him a spot back into In N Out."
