# MVP Portfolio
This  read me needs a real update...

## The ideas
* Ant hill, inspired by Ant world https://discordapp.com/invite/C9CvQjt
(The landscape [which will have blowing wind, and moving clouds] and later added maze game to the Ant World Link.) 
* The box, inspired by Anoukia Perry - In Pink https://www.pink.anoukiaperrey.com
(The Corner Corp. Box displaying all our different sections. These sections include: Software 
Engineering Portfolio, Literature, Music, Photography & Art, The Corner Corp., Biography and 
more[such as acting career and such])
* Scrolling Sections, inspired by irui.is https://iuri.is
(When a user zooms into one of the sections, it will take them to another page that talks about 
that sections specifics, and when you scroll down, it should be clean and tell more about each 
sections important parts.)
* Ant Attack, inspired by Contrast visuals.com https://contrast-visuals.com/info/
(mini game where the ants run away like our IB, and users can smash them if they click on them. 
This will be an endless game, just for esthetics)
* Season Decorations, inspired by my first portfolio https://codepen.io/makemesenpai/full/vrVxvW
(Each CSS decorations will be held on each page, which will be on a timer or switch so that when 
the seasons change, we can change with them.)

## The Plan
To incorporate all my ideas into a clean, professional, and immersive website. Using dynamic 
styling and art, I hope to show the best representation of myself here. As Well as a nearly 
complete representation of everything and anything I am. I worry that I am too ambitious, and 
not enough. So I hope to continuously work hard until I am more than enough, and all my dreams 
and ambitions can simply become tasks that can be done.

## ToDo
SkateBoard: Based on wire-frames, create the home page using only html and css. This should be 
clear as to what the intentions are and how the website should look. This must include landscape 
art, and a place holding block in the center of the screen for our cube. [√]

Bike: using javascript, set up a local server, and make a base for all the other pages. These pages
will include scroll sections, and links to main sections, or back home. Other pages that need work
or you feel are unfitting still must be made, but do not require a link on our cube. [√]

Car: Make the cube work, and give all unready sections an un-clickable "coming soon" icon. Fix 
most if not all problems with website and make your website live. []

Stretch Limo: Create Ant Attack, and Season Decorations []

Crazy Chopper: Create Maze game. Update website once a year. Place the link to your MVP 
portfolio on all pages that you have worked on under contract or small personal projects. []

### Feedback
love the scroll indicator on the left but the font is tough for me to read :cry: so i don't know all the awesome things you've done ~D

Maybe space out the sections a little more
ex: experiences, projects, skills, etc ~P

I like that the top bar scrolls with the page but since there’s no background, you end up with text on text. You could make the background “appear” when you start to scroll if that’s something you want to fix. Also, personally I’m not sure what the difference between Engineering Projects and Hobby Projects is and it might give the impression that you’re done talking about projects when you finish the Engineering Projects section. Also I just realized the scroll indicator is clickable, super cool ~M

1. Change the font.  I can't read it without effort.  That probably means others will be similarly turned off by it.
2. Not a big deal, but each of the nodes down the left are clickable except for the top one.  Why isn't the top one clickable?
3. Overall the content is good, however on my screen, there is too much white-space with each project. Perhaps set on page margins that condense the page to the middle and have the white space on the left and right?  Totally up to you if you do this or disregard.

Like I said, overall, the content itself is
good.

P.S. Hey, more on the portfolio... Have you looked at it on a phone? The page doesn't show up well at all in terms of formatting. You should definitely fix that! ~D
