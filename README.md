## More Info

### Idea
I wanted to incorporate all my experience, publications, and projects in one place that I could be really proud of. I hoped to show the best representation of myself here. As Well as a complete representation of everything and anything I am. I worry that I am too ambitious, and not enough. So I hope to continuously work hard until I am more than enough, and all my dreams and ambitions can simply become tasks that can be done.

Here are the first wire-frames I made when planning this website. The planning took... more hours than I'd like to admit, but I'm glad to see where things have started and where they are headed for.

### Inspirations
* Ant hill, inspired by Ant world https://discordapp.com/invite/C9CvQjt
(The landscape [which will have blowing wind, and moving clouds] and later added maze game to the Ant World Link.) 
* The box, inspired by Anoukia Perry - In Pink https://www.pink.anoukiaperrey.com
(The Corner Corp. Box displaying all our different sections. These sections include: Software 
Engineering Portfolio, Literature, Music, Photography & Art, The Corner Corp., Biography and 
more[such as acting career and such]) https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/cube 
* Scrolling Sections, inspired by irui.is https://iuri.is
(When a user zooms into one of the sections, it will take them to another page that talks about 
that sections specifics, and when you scroll down, it should be clean and tell more about each 
sections important parts.)
* Ant Attack, inspired by Contrast visuals.com https://contrast-visuals.com/info/
(mini game where the ants run away like our IB, and users can smash them if they click on them. 
This will be an endless game, just for esthetics)
* Season Decorations, inspired by my first portfolio https://codepen.io/makemesenpai/full/vrVxvW
(Each CSS decorations will be held on each page, which will be on a timer or switch so that when 
the seasons change, we can change with them.)
