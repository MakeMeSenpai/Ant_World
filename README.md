# MVP Portfolio

## The ideas
* Ant hill, inpires by Ant world https://discordapp.com/invite/C9CvQjt
(The landscape [which will have blowing wind, and moving clouds] and later added maze game to the Ant World Link.) 
* The box, inspired by Anoukia Perry - In Pink https://www.pink.anoukiaperrey.com
(The Corner Corp. Box displaying all our different sections. These sections include: Software 
Engineering Portfolio, Litterature, Music, Photography & Art, The Corner Corp., Biography and 
more[such as acting career and such])
* Scrolling Sections, inpired by irui.is https://iuri.is
(When a user zooms into one of the sections, it will take them to another page that talks about 
that sections pecifics, and when you scroll down, it should be clean and tell more about each 
sections important parts.)
* Ant Atttack, inpired by Contrast visuals.com https://contrast-visuals.com/info/
(mini game where the ants run away like our IB, and users can smash them if they click on them. 
This will be an endless game, just for esthetics)
* Season Decorations, inpired by my first portfolio https://codepen.io/makemesenpai/full/vrVxvW
(Each CSS decorations will be held on each page, which will be on a timer or switch so that when 
the seasons change, we can change with them.)

## The Plan
To incorportate all my ideas into a clean, professional, and immersive website. Using dynamic 
styling and art, I hope to show the best representation of myself here. As Well as a nearly 
complete representation of everything and anything I am. I worry that I am too ambitious, and 
not enough. So I hope to continuuosly work hard until I am more than enough, and all my dreams 
and ambitions can simpky become tasks that can be done.

## ToDo
SkateBoard: Based on wireframes, create the home page using only html and css. This should be 
clear as to what the intentions are and how the website should look. This must include landscape 
art, and a place holding block in the center of the screen for our cube. [√]

Bike: using javascript, set up a local server, and make a base for all the other pages. These pages
will include scoller sections, and links to main sections, or back home. Other pages that need work
or you feel are unfitting still must be made, but do not require a link on our cube.  []

Car: Make the cube work, and give all unready sections an unclickable "comming soon" icon. Fix 
most if not all problems with website and make your website live. []

Stretch Limo: Create Ant Attack, and Season Decorations []

Crazy Chopper: Create Maze game. Update website once a year. Place the link to your MVP 
portfolio on all pages that you have worked on under contract or small personal projects. []
