        <p id="bio">Hi, my name is Anthony Protho, and I am an amateur Software Developer, <br>Artist, and Engineer. As
            an
            engineer, I have built, and programmed robots using VEX robotic kits, as well as developed numerous creative
            solutions to manufacturing machines.
            I have been seen, by my classmates and teachers, to be a leader. My hope is to grow into being a better
            leader,
            in order to help guide my team to our victory! I love all genres of art, and because of this I have worked
            on an
            amount of different
            forms of art. From acting to painting. I am currrently writting a book, and have been making a mini series
            of my
            own. Though many of those art projects will go unfinished, my programming will not! I have grown a love for
            programming as soon
            as I learned about it. The creativity, and being able to become a "hacker" in my middle school eyes was the
            coolest thing. Not to mention the pay. It's funny remebering when I was young and didnt know what I wanted
            to
            be, I just googled highest
            paying jobs. And like destiney there it was. My main priority is to learn more, and become a proffessional
            programmer. Here are some of my latest projects.</p>
